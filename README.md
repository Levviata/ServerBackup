# Server Backup

A plugin that backups you minecraft server with a variety of features, learn more on the [original website](https://server-backup.net/) or [original wiki](https://github.com/SF-Sudio/ServerBackup/wiki).

# Objectives/Intentions

In general, I want to fix bugs here and there, possibly improve code quality, basic documentation, and neatly pack everything together for better support down the line. 

My main course of idea(s) is: If it works, _don't touch it_ (minimize rewriting code)

May or may not rename fork for clarity in the future.

_No promises._
