# ServerBackup

A plugin that backups you minecraft server with a variety of features, learn more on the [original website](https://server-backup.net/).

# Objectives/Intentions

In general, I want to fix bugs here and there, possibly improve code quality, basic documentation, and neatly pack everything together for better support down the line. 

May or may not rename fork for clarity in the future.

_No promises._
